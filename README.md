Once you are taken to the welcome page, there will be an option to register the new user since the app is secured with Spring security using data-jpa.
Registered users can login with their credentials and visit the dashboard of the app.
There is also OAuth2 authentication using google, facebook and github. So users can use this instead of the registration.
